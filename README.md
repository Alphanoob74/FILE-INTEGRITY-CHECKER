## DESCRIPTION ##

🛡️ Folder Integrity Checker (with GUI)

   Detect. Alert. Protect.
   A lightweight Python tool that monitors any folder for file modifications, additions, and deletions using cryptographic hashing and a GUI           interface—ideal for cybersecurity, forensics, and data integrity monitoring.

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
Component	                   Description
🐍 Python 3.x	               Core programming language used to build the application.
📦 Hashlib	                 Python's built-in library to compute secure SHA-256 file hashes.
📁 os & json	               For directory traversal and data storage (hash records).
🖼️ Tkinter	                 Standard Python library for creating a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI).
📄 ScrolledText	             Allows viewing long output logs in the GUI cleanly.

🚀 Features

    ✅ Real-time integrity checks of folders using cryptographic hashes.

    🧠 Intelligent detection of:

        🆕 New files

        ⚠️ Modified files

        ❌ Deleted files

    🧪 First-time scan saves a secure snapshot as hash_store.json.

    📜 Outputs changes in a clean, scrollable GUI window.

    🖱️ Easy-to-use buttons to browse folders and start scanning.

🛠️ How to Use

    Install Python if not already installed:
    https://www.python.org/downloads/

    Run the script:

    python folder_gui_checker.py

    Use the GUI:

        Click "Browse Folder" to select the directory.

        Click "Check Folder Integrity" to scan and detect changes.

        Changes will appear in the window (first-time scan will save hash records).

📂 Output

    GUI shows:

        🆕 New files added

        ⚠️ Modified files (content changed)

        ❌ Deleted files

💡 Ideal Use Cases

    🔒 Cybersecurity monitoring and digital forensics

    🗂️ Academic or legal document change detection

    🧪 Detecting unauthorized changes in software/code projects

📌 Future Improvements

    🕒 Scheduled automatic integrity checks

    📨 Email or system notifications on detection

    🧾 Export report to .txt or .csv
